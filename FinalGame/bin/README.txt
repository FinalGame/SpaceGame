Several people have asked for the source, so it is included in this
directory. If you want to compile it, you'll have to figure out how to
do it yourself. (If you eat Makefiles for breakfast, you'll find one
in the directory above this one.)

Please note that SpaceGame was my first Java program > 100 lines of
code. It was written in an attempt to make this old C programmer learn
some Java. Please do not take if for more than just that. In
particular, don't take it as an example on how to create good games in
Java.
